      <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
      <p> I am a 26 years old graduate student, passionate about design and I like to think that I am pretty creative. I live with my fiance and our two cats in Timisoara, Romania. I am currently searching for a motivating job that will allow me to put in practice what I've learned along the years.</p>
	  <h3>Why I have no job experience</h3>
		<p> When I was still a student, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and short after my grandmother's Alzheimer's advanced rapidly. I was the only person in the household who could've take care of them, I took the resposability to be their care taker and I had to press pause on my career. After my grandmother passed away, my grandfather was diagnosed with dementia. I decided to stick around, to help my recovering mother take care of her dad.  </p>
	<h3> AFTERMATH</h3>
		<p> In the years that passed I followed different courses, mostly learning Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator and recently I started a course on Udemy named The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021, that reminded me how much I enjoyed working with HTML and CSS. I also learned by myself Java and Android Studio for my license degree project.</p>
	<h3> PROJECTS</h3>
		<p>I have numerous projects both personal and on demand. I did logo's for two E-sports teams, I take and edit pictures for my mother's hand-made decorations bussines and also did the logo for it. I love making portrait illustrations of pets and humans. Web related, the first project I did was for my High School certificate, the main theme being the band The Wanted. I also did projects for the University using Adobe Dreamweaver, but sadly I lost all the work I've done. I know it sounds a lot like the excuse "my dog ate my homework" but this things happen. </p>
